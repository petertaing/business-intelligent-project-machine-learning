In this lab, we will first build recommender systems based on movie rating data. We then perform social network analysis based on a small Facebook data.

Part 1: Recommender Systems
We will use the MovieLense data set (downloaded from http://www.grouplens.org/), which contains around 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.

In this MovieLense data set, each row corresponds to a user, and each column corresponds to a movie.

Part 2: Social Network Analysis
We will use a small Facebook data from stanford network analysis project: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html.

The social network is stored by an edgelist.
