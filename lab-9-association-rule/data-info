Market basket analysis is used behind the scenes for the recommendation systems used in many brick-and-mortar and online retailers. The learned association rules indicate the combinations of items that are often purchased together. Knowledge of these patterns provides insight into new ways a grocery chain might optimize the inventory, advertise promotions,or organize the physical layout of the store. For instance, if shoppers frequently purchase coffee or orange juice with a breakfast pastry, it may be possible to increase profit by relocating pastries closer to coffee and juice.

In this lab, we will perform a market basket analysis of transactional data from a grocery store.Our market basket analysis will utilize the purchase data collected from one month of operation at a real-world grocery store. The data contains 9,835 transactions.
