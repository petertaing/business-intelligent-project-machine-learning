# business-intelligent-project-machine-learning

Data is a critical capital for modern business. Empowered by rapid developments of information
technology, organizations increasingly depend on business intelligence (BI) to extract useful
information from diverse and rich data by using BI software. It allows for automatically discovering
patterns to unleash the value of historical data and enables us to better: understand data, monitor the
reliability of a system, perform market segmentation, improve the success of marketing campaigns,
and much, much more. This course introduces theories, techniques, and applications in business
intelligence, data mining, and business analytics. Topics include classification, numeric prediction,
clustering, association rule mining, recommender system, and social network analysis.

By completing these projects, I learned (1) basic concepts, fundamental information theories and methodologies in
business intelligence, (2) core techniques/algorithms for data analytics, including classification,
prediction, clustering, association rule mining and advanced data mining techniques, and (3) hands
on practices of major data mining techniques with real-world business applications. This is
accomplished through lectures, in-class exercises, individual assignments, and labs of using Python
and Google Colab.
